I created a 2D Platformer game because game development is something I am interested in. After learning how to use Pygame, I was successful in creating a level in which the user could control and navigate obstacles. I found a useful tutorial on Youtube that taught me the basics of Pygame, as well as how to design levels and implement effects. 

In order to run the code, open the main file.
